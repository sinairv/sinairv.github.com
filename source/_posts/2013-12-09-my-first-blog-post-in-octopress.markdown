### Hello World.

This is my first blog post in *Octopress*, if you know what I mean.

This is a `variable_name`.

This is code with no lang specified:

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }


and a code in C#.

```csharp
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    string str = "asdasdasd";
    double d = 233.323;
    char c = 'a';
    char ch = '\n';
}
```

This is the end.

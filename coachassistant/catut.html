<h2><a name="intro"></a>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction: What is Coach Assistant?</h2>
<p>Coach assistant is a tool for creating positioning patterns and visualizing 
them for a team of coachable players. It can also serve as a tool for visual 
analysis of the players and their relative positions. It generates <i>Coach 
Language</i> (<i>CLang</i> for short) statements for the strategy assigned to 
the team. The generated CLang may need little modification to form a complete 
team's strategy.</p>
<p>In this writing, from the term <i>team</i>, it is meant a team of coachable 
players. You may make use of Standard Coachable Players (<a href="http://rcsscoachable.sourceforge.net">RCSSCoachable</a>) 
for this purpose. Also you need a coach to simply open the CLang file and send 
the statements to the <a href="http://sserver.sourceforge.net">soccer server</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of Coach Assistant were Windows based applications written 
in C++ using Borland C++Builder. The current version (2.1) is written in Java, 
and hence is platform independent. You need Java 1.5 to compile and run the 
application. The source code is also published under GNU General Public License.

<h2><a name="kickstart"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Kick-Start</h2>
<p>In this section you can take a quick guide to grasp the whole idea of what 
the functionalities of Coach Assistant are. Follow the steps:</p>
<p><b>Run Coach Assistant.</b> Go to the <i>bin</i> folder and run <i>run.sh</i> 
or <i>run.bat</i>. You must see a window with a football field in the middle. On 
top of the field there are the players of the right side and left side teams. 
Each side has the players 1 through 11 and an extra <i>X</i> player. Let's call 
the left side team, <i>our team</i>, and the right side team, <i>opp team </i>
(short for opponent team). Besides their intuitive meanings, <i>our</i> and <i>
opp</i> are valid CLang identifiers. You can drag any players to any positions. 
In this current version this is <i>only</i> for visualizing purposes, and does 
not affect the strategy of the team. You can see later that you can define 
positioning for <i>our</i> players 1 through 11. <i>Our</i> player <i>X</i>, and 
all the <i>opp</i> players cannot be assigned any positioning, and hence no 
CLang is generated for them. </p>
<p><b>Open a sample strategy.</b> Press open button on the toolbar, and go to 
the <i>samples</i> folder, and select <i>sample352.cas</i>. Now toggle the <i>
Move the Ball</i> button on the toolbar; the one with the following icon:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="catut_moveball.png" width="20" height="22"></p>
<p>While having this button selected, move the mouse inside the field, and see 
the players positioning accordingly. In this case the mouse pointer plays the 
role of the ball and the players are showing their relative positioning 
regarding the ball.</p>
<p><b>Generate CLang for this strategy.</b> Press the <i>Export CLang</i> 
button; the one with the following icon:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="catut_export.png" width="16" height="16"></p>
<p>Leave the default settings unchanged and press <i>Generate</i>. Choose a file 
name for the generated CLang file. It's now time to test if the generated CLang 
file is doing what you expect it to do.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="coeffs"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp; What are a player's coefficients</h2>
<p>To go to the concept of the player's coefficients, first open <i>coefs1.cas</i> 
from the <i>samples</i> folder. Right click on <i>our 1</i> player, and select
<i>SomeRegion</i> from the context menu. Now you must see two rectangles on the 
field. Toggle the <i>Move the Ball</i> button and move the mouse pointer inside 
the blue rectangle. As you see player <i>our 1</i> positions in such a way that 
as if there is a one-to-one map from the points inside the blue rectangle to the 
points inside the red rectangle. This map is created by performing some 
arithmetic on the ball's coordination. The CLang counterpart of such arithmetic 
is shown in the second element of the status-bar which reads:</p>
<pre>(((pt ball) * (pt 1.34 0.57)) + (pt 46.84 0.0))</pre>
<p>This is interpreted as to form such a map <i>if the ball is inside the blue 
region</i> then the map is created by multiplying the ball's coordination in the 
first ordered pair of numbers (in this case <font face="Courier New" size="2">
(pt 1.34 0.57)</font><font face="Times New Roman">)&nbsp; and adding the result 
points to the second pair of numbers (in this case </font>
<font face="Courier New" size="2">(pt 46.84 0.0)</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">
</font><font face="Times New Roman">). In other references the first ordered 
pair is referred to as the player's <i>attraction</i> to the ball. In this 
application and tutorial we refer to the 4 numbers as the player's coefficients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">See <i>coefs2.cas</i> for an example of a 
horizontal positioning, and <i>coefs3.cas</i> as an example of vertical 
positioning. In both samples, repeat the steps of this sections for player <i>
our 1</i> again. Line positioning is useful when you do not want a player to 
move much in order to keep its stamina.</font></p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="defreg"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Defining a Region</h2>
<p>There exists two types of regions in this application: <i>Ball Region</i>, 
and <i>Player Region</i>. By region we mean a rectangle. Ball Region is drawn in 
blue, and Player Region is drawn in red by convention. There are two ways to 
define a region: drawing it by mouse, or specifying it by its coordination. </p>
<p><b>Draw a region. </b>Let's draw a ball region. Toggle the <i>Draw Ball 
Region</i> button; the one with the following icon:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="catut_drball.png" width="16" height="16"></p>
<p>Drag the mouse pointer on the field to form a ball region.</p>
<p><b>Specify a region by coordination.</b> Press the <i>Specify Ball Region</i> 
button; the one with the following icon:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="catut_spball.png" width="16" height="16"></p>
<p>If you have already drawn (or specified) a ball region, the text fields are 
initialized with the coordination of that region. Modify the contents, or 
specify new coordination yourself. Press OK to see the region.</p>
<p>In either cases, if you want to save the ball region with a name to be 
referred later, press again the <i>Specify Ball Region</i> button; check the <i>
Save as</i> check-box and specify a name for it.</p>
<p>To load an already saved region, press <i>Specify Ball Region</i> button; 
select the <i>Load</i> radio button; and select your region from the list.</p>
<p>The whole process also applies for the player region, with the difference 
that a player region is drawn in red by convention.</p>
<p>Whenever there's one ball region, and one player region present, the map from 
the ball region to the player region is shown in status bar. If you intend to 
use the application for analysis purposes only, you can right-click on status 
bar and copy the relation to the clipboard.</p>
<p>Only one ball region can be shown at each time. Only one player region can be 
shown at each time too.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="render"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp; Rendering a Player's Region</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes you have a map (more specifically a player's 
coefficients) and want to know what would be the player's region. This normally 
happens when you are reading CLang statements which are written by somebody 
other than you. To render a player's coefficients you need the ball's region 
(the domain of the map) and the coefficients. To do so, press the <i>Specify 
Ball and Player Region</i> button; the one with the following icon:</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<img border="0" src="catut_spballplayer.png" width="16" height="16"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The text-fields related to the ball region, are initialized with 
the currently specified ball region coordination. You can modify the contents, 
specify them yourself, or load an existing region. The coefficients and their 
syntax are shown in the dialog. Here <i>C</i> stands for coefficient (the value 
which is going to be multiplied) and <i>O</i> stands for offset (the value which 
is going to be added). The text-fields for these four values are also 
initialized with the relation between the currently specified ball and player 
regions.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="manipreg"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp; Manipulating Regions</h2>
<p>In this section we briefly introduce easy ways/tricks to change regions' 
coordination.</p>
<p><b>Change the coordination of a region's corner. </b>Press specify region, 
and modify the corner's coefficients.</p>
<p><b>Move a player's region some meters horizontally. </b>Open render formula 
dialog. Add the value of <i>O1</i> with the desired distance.</p>
<p><b>Move a player's region some meters vertically. </b>Open render formula 
dialog. Add the value of <i>O2</i> with the desired distance.</p>
<p><b>Make a player's region horizontally wider/narrower. </b>Open render 
formula dialog. Increase/decrease the value of <i>C1.</i></p>
<p><b>Make a player's region vertically wider/narrower. </b>Open render formula 
dialog. Increase/decrease the value of <i>C2.</i></p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="partition"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp; Partitioning the Field</h2>
<p>It is probably obvious for you that if there exists some points in the field, 
for which a player has no positioning assigned to, that player does not move if 
the ball enters those areas. In order to create a complete positioning as seen 
in <i>Sample352.cas</i> one needs to cover all the field. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to use a region as a ball region to define positionings 
for, that region must be a partition. To declare a ball region, as a partition. 
Do the following steps.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Specify your <i>ball</i> region. </b>Either by drawing or 
specifying it by coordination. See Section <a href="#defreg">4</a> for more 
details.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Assign a name for your region.</b> Open the <i>Specify Ball 
Region</i> dialog; Select <i>Save as</i>, and specify a name for it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Add your region to the set of partitions.</b> Press the <i>View 
Partitions</i> button; the one with the following icon:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img border="0" src="catut_partitions.png" width="16" height="16"></p>
<p dir="ltr">In this dialog, you can see all the regions saved so far, and a 
list of partitions. If this list is empty, it means that you have created no 
partitions at all. Also at the far left side of the dialog, you can see a handy 
way of creating and saving new regions fast. To add a region to the list of 
partitions, first select the regions from the list entitled <i>All the Regions</i>. 
Having selected them press the button with caption <i>&gt;</i> to add the selected 
regions to the list of partitions. To remove some regions from the list of 
partitions, simply select them in the list of <i>Partitions</i>, and press the 
button with caption <i>&lt;</i>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is not necessary for the partitions to not overlap. Also it is 
not necessary for the union of the partitions to cover the whole field. If a 
certain player has been assigned positioning in two overlapping partitions, then 
the behavior of the player in the overlapped area is undefined.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Referring to <i>Sample352.cas</i> again, the field is partitioned 
simply into two regions called <i>OurHalf</i>, and <i>OppHalf</i>. The union of 
the two is the whole field. But in Sample <i>coefs1.cas</i> there is only one 
partition which does not cover the field.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="assignpos"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp; Assigning a Positioning to a Player</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Having defined partitions, it is now time to assign positioning of 
the players when the ball enters any of the partitions. You can view any of the 
partitions names, by right clicking on any of <i>our</i> players 1 through 11, 
and selecting one by name. Now it's time to define your desired player 
positioning for this partition. Draw a player region either by specifying its 
coordination, or drawing it, as described in section <a href="#defreg">4</a>. 
Now there are two ways to assign what you have drawn to a specific player to 
position accordingly:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>1.</b> Right click on your player of choice, and select, <i>Set 
Specified Region</i>. To test if it had worked toggle <i>Move the Ball</i>, and 
see the result.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b>2.</b> Right click on the second element of the status bar where 
the coefficients of this positioning is written. Select <i>Set For</i>, and 
choose the player from the sub-menu. Again toggle <i>Move the Ball</i> to test 
if it had worked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To form a complete strategy, one needs to assign positioning for 
each of the players in each of the partitions. That would add up to the number 
of partitions times the number of players, player regions. Referring to <i>
Sample353.cas</i> it defines positioning for players 2 through 11, in two 
partitions, which will be a total 20 player regions. (Player 1 is left out, 
because Standard Coachable Players provide default positioning for the goalie. 
Anyway if one needs to customize positioning of the goalie, he/she must define 
positioning for the goalie too.) </p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="vispos"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp; Visualizing a Positioning</h2>
<p>If you want to speculate, how a certain player positions in different 
partitions, right click on the player, and select the partitions, one by one. 
The blue region, is the ball region (or the partition itself) and the red region 
is the player's assigned region to position. If there is no region specified for 
a partition, then there will be no red region drawn on the field. You can test 
this section using <i>Sample352.cas</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to TOC</a></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="modpos"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp; Modifying a Positioning </h2>
<p>To change an existing positioning assigned to a player, you must define a new 
player region, and assign it <i>again</i> to the player. To modify an existing 
ball region you may find it useful to see section <a href="#manipreg">6</a>. 
First visualize the existing region, by right clicking on the player, and 
selecting the partition name, from the context menu. After you have created the 
new region, it is not assigned to the player unless you do it explicitly. For 
this purpose, either right click on the player and select <i>Set Specified 
Region</i>, or right click on the second element of the status-bar, and select
<i>Set For</i>, and specify the player's number from the sub-menu. Toggle <i>
Move the Ball</i> and move the mouse pointer on the ball region to make sure 
that the new region is assigned to the player.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="clang"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp; Generating CLang</h2>
<p>To generate CLang statements of the strategy currently open, press the <i>
Export CLang</i> button; the one with the following icon:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="catut_export.png" width="16" height="16"></p>
<p>Here it comes a description for each option:</p>
<p><b>Prefix.</b> Prefix is the user's defined rule name prefix. In the 
generated CLang the positioning rule names are by default made up of the term <i>
RULE</i> plus the region name (i.e. partition name) plus the player's uniform 
number. One can specify a prefix to be placed between<i> RULE</i> and the region 
name.<i> </i></p>
<p><b>Positioning Radius.</b> By defining a positioning radius, the players do 
not have to position to an exact point, but they position into a circle around 
the point with a certain radius. The circle's radius is referred to as the 
player's <i>Positioning Radius</i>. While using Standard Coachable Players it is 
not needed to make use of positioning radius. </p>
<p><b>Generate Shooting Capabilities.</b> Generates a set of rules which enables 
a player who is close enough to the opponent goal to shoot the ball rather than 
passing it to another teammate.</p>
<p><b>Add play-mode play-on Condition.</b> Sets (or <i>and</i>s if not empty) 
the conditions of generated positioning rules with
<font face="Courier New" size="2">(playm play_on)</font> condition.</p>
<p><b>Add Custom Condition.</b> <i>And</i>s the conditions of the generated 
positioning rules, with the user provided condition. The syntax of the condition 
must be checked by the user himself/herself. Obviously, to obey the syntax of 
CLang the condition must be enclosed in parentheses. </p>
<p><b>Freedom Radius Condition.</b> As an example consider that the user has 
specified a Freedom Radius of 2.0 meters. It means that if the distance of the 
player from the ball is more than 2.0 meters they follow the positioning rule, 
otherwise the positioning rule does not fire (it might be more wise for the 
player to intercept the ball rather than position to some other point). The user 
can later add some hand coded rules, for his/her desired behavior for such 
cases. While using Standard Coachable Players, the closest player to the ball 
intercepts the ball by default, and hence there is no need to specify Freedom 
Radius, unless the user intends some other behaviors. </p>

<h2><a name="futwork"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
<p>Initially earlier versions of Coach Assistant were created for some research 
about recognizing patterns of positioning of the players of a team and 
describing them in CLang. During RoboCup 2005 Coach Competitions (held in Osaka, 
Japan) all the positioning and overall behavior of the patterns were generated 
using Coach Assistant. Also in RoboCup 2006 Coach Competitions (held in Bremen, 
Germany) all the <i>100%</i>&nbsp; of the overall behaviors of the participants' 
submitted patterns, were based upon the patterns which were created using the 
same software.</p>
<p>For the coming Coach Competitions, there is an argument on how to 
create/generate realistic patterns. Unfortunately currently this software is by 
no means an <i>automatic</i> pattern creation tool. But it can help speeding up 
creating patterns, and through its visual environment helps creating reasonable 
realistic behaviors. Minor modifications might be needed to make different 
patterns out of a certain base strategy. </p>
<p>Coach Assistant can be extended to visually design other behaviors rather 
than positioning (behaviors such as, passing, dribbling, or some other composite 
actions). Also it might serve as the base for the tool officially used for 
creating patterns. Also it can be extended to an automatic pattern creation 
tool.</p>

      <title>How to reduce the pain of working with TFS using Git TFS</title>

      <description>Git TFS is a program that extends git commands to talk to a TFS remote repository (instead of a git repository). It creates a real git repository and replays the TFS history on top of it. It can be treated as a real git repository except for when it comes to cloning and syncing. In spite of that it still makes a programmer&amp;rsquo;s life much easier.
The best starting point is the project&amp;rsquo;s ReadMe file on GitHub.</description>

      <description>The source code for this post is on GitHub.
When it comes to mocking a DbSet to test various read and write operations things may get a little bit tricky. Mocking a DbSet for a write operation (Add, Update, or Remove) is quite straightforward. But testing a synchronous read operation requires mocking the whole IQueryable interface. Even more trickier than that is testing an asynchronous read operation which requires mocking an IDbAsyncQueryProvider interface.</description>

      <description>The switch data type is used to control whether a switch (as in arguments or options passed to a function or command) is provided for the function/command or not. Suppose that there is a function called Switch-Demo that can accept -Force and -Quiet switches. These switches just work as toggles. What we care about them is whether they exist or not. There are no pieces of data accompanying them. The PowerShell switch data-type suits this purpose:</description>

The tool is able to get the code, apply syntax highlighting to it based on the syntax of the language selected, and then create HTML based on the theme selected (e.g., MSDN theme). I didn&amp;rsquo;t assign more time on making the tool better and better, as better ways of doing the same task were emerging, and also other by-products of the tool were becoming more interesting at the time; e.</description>

      <description>I could gracefully install and test earlier versions of Android Studio before they adopted Gradle for their build system. After doing the upgrade I could no longer build a single project with weird error messages relating to Gradle. I searched the web, and found some workarounds in stackoverflow, e.g., manually installing Gradle, updating environment variables and so and so. None of them were helpful for me, although they seemed to be solving the issue for many (who have voted for the answers).</description>

      <description>Recently I was involved with enabling validation for a Windows Forms form containing several pages shown through a tree view. There were one user control defined for each page, therefore whenever a node in tree-view got activated, an instance of that user-control were shown. The user-controls did not have a common user-defined parent base-class or interface. The author of the existing code had defined a Save method in each control separately which performed updating data with values entered in the forms.</description>

      <description>Based on Wikipedia, originally a Koan in Zen-practice is a paradoxical question that provokes doubt and tests a student&amp;rsquo;s progress. On the other hand, programming Koans are a set of failing unit-tests, for which the learner is required to fix the code or fill the required fields with proper values in order to make each test pass. Probably one of the earliest and most popular Koans were Ruby Koans. Now there are several Koans implemented for different languages and frameworks.</description>

On 21 March 2012, the CodePlex team announced their support for Git.
Creating a project with Git as source control is very easy in CodePlex and is done with a few clicks at no time. Suppose the project name is CodePlexGitTest. In order to make any changes to the project structure you need to clone the project first.</description>

      <description>These are some easy steps required to setup Git for Windows:
 Download msysGit from: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit
I prefer to use the portable version. At the time of this writing there&amp;rsquo;s no difference between 32 bit and 64 bit versions and the filename for the portable version is: PortableGit-1.7.10-preview20120409.7z. Currently it seems that the development of the project has been moved to GitHub, but the releases are still located in Google Code.</description>

As an example, imagine a class called SampleClass located in a directory in which there exists a text file with the name of SomeFile.</description>

This job is quite easy to accomplish, but since I&amp;rsquo;ve written it too many times from scratch, I put them in the following gist.
The IntervalOverlapKinds.cs file defines the IntervalOverlapKinds enumeration. The interval detection is carried out in the static methods of the IntervalOverlap class.</description>

The following code snippets will help. The FindStringAndSetColor method looks for instances of an arbitrary string in the contents of the RichTextBox, while the FindTokenAndSetColor method looks for whole words (tokens).

      <description>In normal situations you cannot view the content of special folders, such as Windows/assembly or Windows/fonts, and so on. The way these folders are shown are set through the desktop.ini file in each of these folders, which is normally hidden and protected. One trick that I learned from here [+] is described below. Open a command prompt and type:
cd /d %windows%\assembly attrib -r -h -s desktop.ini ren desktop.ini desktop.bak  Using the above commands, we kill the desktop.</description>

      <description>First off, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what&amp;rsquo;s going on in C# compiler when you use const or readonly in your field definitions. The const qualifier can be used with primitive data types, and strings only. When used, the value assigned to a const field, is inserted directly in all its references in the generated IL code. This is true about other assemblies too. Other assemblies that refer to that const field, are compiled as if they have used directly the value itself.</description>

      <description>Suppose that you have a class with various non-public fields, e.g., the class named ClassToTest below servers as a good example.
public class ClassToTest { public int SomeNumber { get; set; } private int m_somePrivateProperty { get; set; } private int m_somePrivateVar; private static int s_someStaticNumber; }  And suppose that we desire to assign some value to the private variable m_somePrivateVar, and the private property m_somePrivateProperty. The approach is to iterate through the fields of the ClassToTest type to find the desired field.</description>

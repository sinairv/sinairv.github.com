* Simple form: text boxes, and buttons. Press a button, some text boxes are read from, other text boxes are updated
* Use case: I generally use for code generation, simple scripts that get numerous, or multi-line inputs.
* Example: TODO: find a good and simple example

LinqPad provides a heavenly `Dump` function, that is capable of displaying virtually anything in the results pane. Give it a string, it will print it in console. 
Give it a collection it will show it in a grid. Give it nested collection of collections it will render the hierarchy in the grid.

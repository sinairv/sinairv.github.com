# About

My name is Sina Iravanian (pronounced `/si:'na: i:r@va:ni:'a:n/` and spelled in Persian as سینا ایروانیان). I was born in Tehran, Iran in June 1983.

I am a software developer, experienced mainly on Microsoft technologies. Besides the professional experience, I have several research experiences on major branches of AI (mainly natural language processing, and financial time-series prediction).

I love open-source software, and would love to make my tools and utilities publicly available. I've already made some of them open-source (see [my ohloh profile](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/sina_iravanian)), and will do the same to the rest when I find the time to clean-up the code and add some documentations. And wait, the product to my last job is also an open-source software called [Virastyar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/virastyar/). I contributed a set of natural language processing components and the Microsoft Word Addin using VSTO and C#.

Although I'm a very lazy blogger, I maintain two blogs (one in [Persian](http://sinairv.blogspot.com/) and the other in [English](http://sinairv.wordpress.com/)). The English blog is a technical one, which I use to log my experiences :), and contains code snippets and coding patterns which I find repeating and happening regularly.

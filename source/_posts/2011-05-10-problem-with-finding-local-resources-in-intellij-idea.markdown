Some classes use external data files which are located in the same directory as the one that the `.java` file is located, or somewhere nearby which can be easily addressed with a relative path. This happens a lot for me, esp. when I am running open source programs developed by someone else. As an example, imagine a class called `SampleClass` located in a directory in which there exists a text file with the name of `SomeFile.txt`. One way to have access to the file is through calling the class-loader's `getResource` function:

```java
URL theURL = this.getClass().getResource("SomeFile.txt");
System.out.println(theURL.toString());
```

I tested this piece of code in *NetBeans* and it works fine. But not in *Intellij IDEA*! To solve this (annoying) problem, I needed to add the path of the source directory to `classpath`. For this purpose I did the following steps in Intellij IDEA 10.0.3 Community Edition:

1. Right click on the module name and select "Open Module Settings"
2. Select "Modules" from the leftmost pane
3. Select "Dependencies" tab
4. Press "Add..." button and select "1 Single-Entry Module Libraryâ€¦" from the popup menu
5. Find and select the "src" folder of your sources.
6. Under the "Scope" column, change the scope to "Runtime"
7. Press Apply and OK

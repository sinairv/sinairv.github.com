![Sina Iravanian](/images/Sina-Gravatar.jpeg)

My name is Sina Iravanian (pronounced `/si:'na: i:r@va:ni:'a:n/` and spelled in Persian as سینا ایروانیان). I was born in Tehran, Iran in June 1983.

I am a software developer, experienced mainly on Microsoft technologies. Besides the professional experience, I have several research experiences on major branches of AI (mainly machine learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, and natural language processing).

I love open-source software, and would love to make my tools and utilities publicly available. I've already made some of them open-source (see [my ohloh profile](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/sina_iravanian)), and will do the same to the rest when I find the time to clean-up the code and add some documentation.

I own 2 other blogs; one in [Persian](http://sinairv.blogspot.com/) and the other in [English](http://sinairv.wordpress.com/) which has been moved to the current blog.

I've moved my blog from [Wordpress](http://sinairv.wordpress.com) to my [homepage domain](http://www.sinairv.com). It makes use of [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), which is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and is a static site generator. The blog is hosted on GitHub pages, and is [open source](https://github.com/sinairv/sinairv.github.com). 

The great benefit of this stack of tools is that I can easily create and edit my posts in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), re-generate the blog [through command line](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/), and make use of [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) (Ruby's make tools) to perform various tasks ranging from post creation to deployment to GitHub pages. It's awesome.
